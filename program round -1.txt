Algorithm

Step 1: get the input as 5 to print only five times
Step 2:first loop over the first row to print 55555 (iterate it by checking 1-5)
Step 3:  once it is printed 5 times it should move to next line by decrementing 1 and printing 54444

Step 4: like wise loop over all the output

Step 5: here point to be noted is second row 5 is printed once and third row 54 like this it going on

Step 6 : while looping over it we need to check and based on the position we need to increment the values

foreach (i=1 i<=5 i++)
foreach(j=1 j<5 j++)
if (i=j)
print 5 \n
else
print 5 \t
endforeach 
endforeach
